You've been growing and moving around so much lately. You're mother and I can't wait to see your face and hold you in our arms.  
  
Lately I've been really thinking about life and taking more serious than ever before the gift of it supplied to us by God. I have every inclination that from a very early age, you'll be an amazing child of God. I'm eagerly awaiting how He will use you to advance His kingdom.
