Last week you decided that you are not going to sleep in your crib. You can be completely asleep and if Dad or I try to put you in your crib you immediately wake up mad. I don't get it, you have a nice comfy crib but you would rather sleep on the couch or in your car seat. Is this a cruel joke you are playing on us?
