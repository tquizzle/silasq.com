As the days turn into months time sure has flown by since your birth. You've made me think about many things in this world, not the least of which is how I want you to live.

I've found myself reading more these days, and I hate reading, but I'm reading on how to be a better father for you and how to raise you to be the man I will be proud of. Here are a few things that I really want you to know.

	
  1. Pray and be a spiritual leader in your home, workplace and church.
  2. Play sports. It will teach you how to win honorably, lose gracefully, respect authority, work with others, manage your time and stay out of trouble.
  3. Save money when you're young because you're going to need it some day.
  4. You will set the tone for the sexual relationship, so don't take something away from her that you can't give back.
  5. Don't ever be a bully and don't ever start a fight, but if some idiot starts it, defend yourself.
  6. Your knowledge and education are things that nobody can take away from you.
  7. Always treat women kindly. Always.
  8. Be strong and tender at the same time.
  9. Mutual respect is the key to good relationships.
  10. "Yes ma'am" and "yes sir" are still expected of you all the time.
  11. Peer pressure is a horrible thing. Be a good leader and others will follow.
  12. Bringing her flowers for no reason is always a good idea. Trust me on this one!
  13. Be patriotic. Show everyone that you love your country.
  14. Please choose your spouse wisely. My daughter-in-law will be the gatekeeper for me spending time with the two of you and my grandchildren.
  15. Remember to call your parents because we might be missing you.

With Love,
Pop
